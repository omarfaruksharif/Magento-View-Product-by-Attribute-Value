# Magento-View-Product-by-Attribute-Value

Usually we view the Products in Magento system by visting: http://example.com/catalog/product/__view__/id/__PRODUCT_ID__ .
But sometimes, need to see a product which we don't know about the __"ID"__ but about it's some attribute, like __"SKU"__. 
For this purpose, I have created an extension where you can view a product even if you don't know the __"ID"__ of the product. You have to just go to the following:
http://example.com/catalog/product/__viewby__/__sku__/__PRODUCT_SKU_VALUE__ .
